# What's OpenVeo Devices API?

OpenVeo Devices API is an [OpenVeo](https://github.com/veo-labs/openveo-core) plugin.

OpenVeo Devices API offers an API to interact and control devices through OpenVeo Socket namespaces. Actually there is only one device supported, the [Veobox](http://www.veo-labs.com/veobox).

**Nb:** OpenVeo Devices API does not create any back end or front end pages.
